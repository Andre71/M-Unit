M-Unit
======

MUMPS (M) Unit Testing functionality.  This version was generated with the 
namespace %ut for OSEHRA based on the original XTMUNIT functionality that 
I wrote while working with the Department of Veteran Affairs.

It can be run at the command line, but also includes a GUI client application 
which was modified to work with this version of the M-Unit functionality.  
The source code for the GUI client and the compiled application are included 
in separate zip files.
